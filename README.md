# SistemaAvaliativo

The system is based on the interaction between two types of users: students and teachers. Teachers can, through the program, build quizzes with numerical, alternative, or essay questions and then make the quiz available for students in their class to answer. The system will automatically correct the answers, giving the student a percentage score and giving automatic feedback to both student and teacher.
